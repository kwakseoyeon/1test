In the planning stage, the agent breaks down large tasks into smaller, manageable subgoals, enabling efficient handling of complex tasks. The agent can also do self-criticism and self-reflection over past actions, learn from mistakes and refine them for future steps, thereby improving the quality of final results. The memory component provides the agent with the capability to retain and recall information over extended periods, often by leveraging an external vector store and fast retrieval. The tool use component allows the agent to call external APIs for extra information that is missing from the model weights, including current information, code execution capability, access to proprietary information sources and more. The design of generative agents combines LLM with memory, planning and reflection mechanisms to enable agents to behave conditioned on past experience, as well as to interact with other agents. \\n\",\n",
